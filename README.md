The Beverage Buddy is a robot that will take away your empty can/bottle and grab you another cool one from the fridge! The que for the robot to take away your empty vessel will be placing it in a specific spot that is monitored via a sensor (undecided). It will also sort the empty vessel into separate recycling bins by material type, e.g. glass or aluminium (possibly also plastic). An extended feature of the Beverage Buddy could be to fill up a cup with a drink and hand it to you without spillage.
