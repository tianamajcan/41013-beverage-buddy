Overview:
The Beverage Buddy is a robot that will take away your empty can/bottle and grab you another cool one from the fridge! The que for the robot to take away your empty vessel will be placing it in a specific spot that is monitored via a sensor (undecided). It will also sort the empty vessel into separate recycling bins by material type, e.g. glass or aluminium (possibly also plastic). An extended feature of the Beverage Buddy could be to fill up a cup with a drink and hand it to you without spillage.

Choose robot and gripper:
To create ‘Beverage Buddy’ we are choosing to use Dobot Magician. Dobot Magician has a kit called ‘Soft Gripper’ which appear and act more like human fingers than the regular gripper types. This gripper is designed to handle more fragile items and would be more suitable for picking and placing glass or aluminium bottles. This type of Gripper is also safe for human-robot collaboration with special silicones which also allow for hygienic handling of beverages and an easy clean.
